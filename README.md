# vyoma-riscv-ctb
This is a repository of my work for the RISC-V Capture the Bug Hackathon 2023. 

## Part 1 - Report
Objective : Produce an initial report in the IEEE format. It should contain
1. Understanding and history of processor hardware bugs
2. Understanding of a open-source RISCV processor design chosen by you

I plan to base my work on the openhw [CV32E40P core.](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p)

## Part 2 - Implementation
TBD
